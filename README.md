## Description

Memory Verse App serves as a way for users to memorize Bible verses using the ESV translation. It utilizes the ESV API. Upon loading into the app, users will be greeted with a card that they can flip. On the front is the verse in its entirety. On the back is the quiz. Each round of the quiz will take away three words from the verse until there are no words left. After all words have been correctly answered, a new verse will appear for the user to be quizzed on. At any time, the user can flip the card back over to reference the verse in full, or they can request a new verse from the API.
